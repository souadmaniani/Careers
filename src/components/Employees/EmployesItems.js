Even 11 months into my tenure here, I am still impressed by my peers’ domain expertise and product-building abilities. But more importantly, our engineering team has an incredible culture of sharing this knowledge and leveling up every member of the team. I am 10 times the engineer I was a year ago; every engineer at Dandy has taught me something that has directly improved my ability to build scalable solutions for dentists.",
